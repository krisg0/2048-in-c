# 2048-in-c
the 2048 game played in terminal written in c
this is a slight modification of the game https://github.com/mevdschee/2048.c
the purpose of this is just for my personal study. i could not undertand the original slideArray function's logic, but i cretaed another implementation of the function, with same result. any feedback is welcome.

to compile from source:
wget https://github.com/krisg0/2048-in-c/blob/main/2048.c
gcc -o 2048 2048.c
./2048
